- **Schedule Meeting**: Schedule a meeting for a later time
- **Recordings**: Review recordings of the previous meeting
- **Personal Room**: A personal meeting room with a fixed invitation link
- **Preview Setup**: Disable audio/video before joining a meeting room
- **Meeting Room Control**: Control audio, video, layout, participant, and screen sharing during the meeting
